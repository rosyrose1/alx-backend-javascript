How to use an ambient Namespace to import an external library
Basic nominal typing with Typescript

TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It's a statically typed superset of JavaScript, meaning that it extends JavaScript by adding syntax for type annotations and other features but ultimately compiles down to plain JavaScript code that can run in any JavaScript runtime environment.

Some key features of TypeScript include:

Static Typing: TypeScript allows developers to define types for variables, parameters, and return values. This helps catch errors during development and provides better tooling support for refactoring and code navigation.

ECMAScript Compatibility: TypeScript is designed to be compatible with ECMAScript (the standard that JavaScript is based on), so any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. This means developers can gradually introduce TypeScript into existing JavaScript projects.

Object-Oriented Programming: TypeScript supports object-oriented programming features such as classes, interfaces, inheritance, and access modifiers, which can help organize and structure code in a more maintainable way.

Module Support: TypeScript has built-in support for ECMAScript modules, allowing developers to write modular code and easily import/export functionality between different files.

Tooling and IDE Support: TypeScript has strong support for tooling and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) such as Visual Studio Code, which provide features like code completion, refactoring tools, and error checking.

Generics: TypeScript supports generics, which allow for writing reusable and type-safe functions and data structures.
